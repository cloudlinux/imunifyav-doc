:::

To install ImunifyAV proceed the following steps:

1. Log in with root privileges to the server where ImunifyAV should be installed.

2. Go to your home directory and run the commands:

```
wget https://repo.imunify360.cloudlinux.com/defence360/imav-deploy.sh -O imav-deploy.sh
bash imav-deploy.sh
```

To install ImunifyAV beta version add argument `--beta`. For example:

```
bash imav-deploy.sh --beta
```

If you already have **ImunifyAV+** license key you can use it during installation:

```
wget https://repo.imunify360.cloudlinux.com/defence360/imav-deploy.sh -O imav-deploy.sh
bash imav-deploy.sh --key YOUR_KEY
```
 
where `YOUR_KEY` is your license key. Replace `YOUR_KEY` with the actual key purchased at [https://www.imunify360.com/](https://www.imunify360.com/).

If you have an IP-based license for **ImunifyAV+**, use IPL as license key:

```
wget https://repo.imunify360.cloudlinux.com/defence360/imav-deploy.sh -O imav-deploy.sh
bash imav-deploy.sh --key IPL
```

To view available options for installation script run:

### Files

Go to ImunifyAV → Files tab. Here, there is a table with a list of infected files within all domains and user accounts.

| ![ImunifyAV → Files tab](/images/AVFilesTab.png) |
|:--:|

The table has the following columns:

* **Scan date** — displays the exact time the scanning process has started.
* **Username** — displays a file owner name.
* **File** — a path where a file is located starting with root
* **Reason** — describes the signature which was detected during the scanning process. Names in this column depend on the signature vendor. You can derive some information from the signature ID itself. `SMW-SA-05155-wshll` – in this Signature ID:
	* The first section can be either `SMW` or `CMW`. `SMW` stands for Server Malware and `CMW` stands for Client Malware
	* The second section of ID can be either `INJ` or `SA`. `INJ` stands for Injection (means Malware is Injected to some legitimate file) and `SA` stands for StandAlone (means File is Completely Malicious)
	* The third section is `05155`. This is simply an identification number for the signature.
	* The fourth section `wshll/mlw.wp/etc` explains the category and class of malware identified. Here, `wshll` stands for web shell (`mlw` stands for malware).
	* The fifth section is `0`, which provides the version number of the signature.
* **Status** — displays the file status:
  * **Infected** — threat was detected after scanning. If a file was not cleaned after cleanup, the info icon is displayed. Hover mouse over info icon to display the reason.
  * **Cleaned** —  infected file is cleaned up.
  * **Content removed** — a file content was removed after cleanup.
  * **Cleanup queued<sup>AV+</sup>** — infected file is queued for cleanup.
Actions:
* **Add to Ignore List** — add file to the Ignore List and remove it from the Malicious files list. Note that if a file is added to the Ignore List, ImunifyAV will no longer scan this file.

### Scan

Malware scanner allows users to scan a specific directory or file for malware. Go to ImunifyAV → Scan tab. Then proceed the following steps:

1. Type a folder name to scan in the _Folder to scan_ field. Start typing with the slash `/`.
It is possible to use _Advanced_ settings:
* **Filename mask** allows to set file type for scanning (for example, `*.php` - all the files with the extension php). The default setting is `*` which means all files without restriction.
* **Ignore mask** allows to set file type to ignore (for example, `*.html` will ignore all files with the extension html).
* <span class="notranslate">**CPU consumption**</span>. Defines the CPU consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency: from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
* <span class="notranslate">**I/O consumption**</span>. Defines the I/O consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency: from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
* <span class="notranslate">**Follow symlinks**</span>. Follow all symlinks within the folder to scan. 

:::tip Note
If ImunifyAV is running on CloudLinux OS, LVE is used to manage scan intensity. If it is running on other operating systems, “nice” is used to control CPU and “ionice” is used when the I/O scheduler is CFQ.
:::

  2. Click _Start_.

| ![](/images/AVMalwareScanner.png) |
|:--:|

At the top right corner scanning progress and status are displayed:

* **Scanner is stopped** means that there is no scanning process running.
* **Scanning…%** means that the scanner is working at the moment. A percentage displays the scanning progress. You can also see the scanning status beneath the _Mask_ or _Advanced_ options.

When scanning is completed, the results are shown in the table below with the following information:

* **Date** — scan date;
* **Path** — scanned folder path;

### Reputation Management <Badge text="AV+"/>

:::tip Note
Reputation Management is available in ImunifyAV+ only.
:::

Reputation Management is an analyzing and notifying tool intended to inform about websites blocking and blacklisting.

Choose _Reputation Management_ in the main menu of the ImunifyAV+ user interface to get to the Reputation Management page.

Reputation Management allows to check if a domain registered on your server is safe or not based on the following reputation engines:

* [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)
* [Yandex Safe Browsing](https://tech.yandex.com/safebrowsing/)
* [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/)
* [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
* [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/).

How does it work:

* We get a list of domains periodically (via crontab)
* Send it to the central Imunify server
* Get results from it
* Add bad domains to the list of Reputation Management

If a domain or an IP is blocked, then this information will be available in the table below. If a user’s website appears in this table, then it would be useful to send [this link](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/hacked/) to the user. This instruction can help to solve problems with the domain.

At the top of the page (also in the main menu near Reputation Management item), ImunifyAV+ shows the number of affected domains. This number is a quantity of affected domains that exist on the server.

The table shows:

* _ID_ – domain owner username
* _Domain_ – the affected domain link
* _Threat type_ – read more about types [on the link](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/reference/rest/v4/ThreatType) (we still do not support THREAT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED and POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION)
* _Vendor_ – where the threat was detected
* _Detection time_ – exact time when the Reputation Management detected the domain
* _Action_ – a link to the actions guide

### Settings

Go to ImunifyAV → Settings tab to set up the behaviour of ImunifyAV scanner. Here you can configure the following:

* [Resource consumption](/imunifyav/#resource-consumption)
* [General](/imunifyav/#general)
* [Background Scanning](/imunifyav/#background-scanning)
* [Malware Cleanup](/imunifyav/#malware-cleanup)
* [Error reporting](/imunifyav/#error-reporting)
* [Notifications](/imunifyav/#notifications)


#### Resource consumption

| ![ImunifyAV → Settings → Resource consumption](/images/AVSettingsResourceConsumption.png) |
|:--:| 

* **CPU consumption** – enables to set a level of CPU usage by Malware Scanner.
  
  ::: tip Note
  Low CPU usage means low scanning speed
  :::

* **I/O consumption** – enables to set a level of I/O usage by Malware Scanner.

  :::tip Note
  Low I/O usage means low scanning speed
  :::

  :::tip Note
  If ImunifyAV is running on CloudLinux OS, LVE is used to manage scan intensity. If it is running on other operating systems, “nice” is used to control CPU and “ionice” is used when the I/O scheduler is CFQ.
  :::

#### General

| ![ImunifyAV → Settings → General](/images/AVSettingsGeneral.png) |
|:--:|

* **Automatically send suspicious and malicious files for analysis** – malicious and suspicious files will be sent to the ImunifyAV Team for analysis automatically.
* **RapidScan** – dramatically speeds up repeated scans based on smart re-scan approach, local result caching and cloud-assisted scan. When you first enable the RapidScan feature, the first scan will run as before. But subsequent scans will see a dramatic speed improvement, anywhere between 5 to 20 times faster. You can find the details here: [https://docs.imunify360.com/features/#rapidscan](https://docs.imunify360.com/features/#rapidscan))
* **Binary (ELF) malware detection** – this option allows to scans user home directories for malware.
* **Enable Hyperscan** – this option allows to use the regex matching Hyperscan library in Malware Scanner to greatly improve the scanning speed. Hyperscan requires its own signatures set that will be downloaded from the files.imunify360.com and compiled locally. There are few platform requirements to use this feature:
  * Hyperscan supports Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS/CloudLinux 7 and later.
  * SSE3 processor instructions support. It is quite common nowadays, but may be lacking in virtual environments or in some rather old servers.

Tick required checkboxes and click the _Save changes_ button.

#### Background Scanning

Allows to set up automatic, scheduled, background scanning of user accounts.

* **Run scanning** — select the desired period:
  * Never
  * Daily*
  * Weekly*
  * Monthly

:::warning Note
The `Daily` and `Weekly` options are available for ImunifyAV+ and Imunify360 only. In ImunifyAV, the setting set to `Daily` and `Weekly` will be reset to `Monthly` - it is expected behavior.
:::

| ![ImunifyAV → Settings → Background Scanning](/images/AVBackgroundScanning.png) |
|:--:| 

Depending on the selected period, precise settings.

* If _Run scanning_ is set to _Daily_, choose the exact time at the _Run at_ dropdown.
* If _Run scanning_ is set to _Weekly_, choose the day of the week at the _Run on_ the dropdown and the exact time at the _Run at_ dropdown.
* If _Run scanning_ is set to _Monthly_, choose the day of the month at the _Day of month to run_ dropdown and the exact time at the _Run at_ dropdown.

#### Malware Cleanup

* **Trim file instead of removal** — do not remove infected file during cleanup but make the file zero-size (for malwares like web-shells);
* **Keep original files for … days** — the original infected file is available for restore within the defined period. Default is 14 days.

| ![](/images/AVSettingsCleanup.png)|

![](/images/ResellersCustomURLs.png)

These options are controlled by `CUSTOM_BILLING.upgrade_url` and `CUSTOM_BILLING.upgrade_url_360` settings accordingly.

## End User Interface

The user side is hidden by default and can be enabled by executing the following command:

```
/usr/share/av-userside-plugin.sh
```

To disable it back, run:

```
/usr/share/av-userside-plugin.sh -r
```

Click _ImunifyAV_ in the main menu. There are following tabs in ImunifyAV end user interface:

* [Files](/imunifyav/#files-2)
* [History](/imunifyav/#history-2)
* [Ignore List](/imunifyav/#ignore-list-2)

### Files

Go to ImunifyAV → Files tab. Here, there is a table with a list of infected files.

| ![ImunifyAV Hoster UI → Files tab](/images/AVUIFiles.png) |
|:--:| 

The table has the following columns:

* **Scan date** — displays the exact time when a file was detected as malicious
* **File** — the path where the file is located starting with root
* **Reason** — describes the signature which was detected during the scanning process. Names in this column depend on the signature vendor. You can derive some information from the signature ID itself. `SMW-SA-05155-wshll` – in this Signature ID:
	* The first section can be either `SMW` or `CMW`. `SMW` stands for Server Malware and `CMW` stands for Client Malware
	* The second section of ID can be either `INJ` or `SA`. `INJ` stands for Injection (means Malware is Injected to some legitimate file) and `SA` stands for StandAlone (means File is Completely Malicious)
	* The third section is `05155`. This is simply an identification number for the signature.
	* The fourth section `wshll/mlw.wp/etc` explains the category and class of malware identified. Here, `wshll` stands for web shell (`mlw` stands for malware).
	* The fifth section is `0`, which provides the version number of the signature.
* **Status** — displays the file status:
  * **Infected** — threat was detected after scanning. If a file was not cleaned after cleanup, the info icon is displayed. Hover mouse over info icon to display the reason
  * **Cleaned** — infected file is cleaned up
  * **Content removed** — a file content was removed after cleanup
  * **Cleanup queued<sup> AV+</sup>** — infected file is queued for cleanup.
* **Actions**:
  * **Add to Ignore List** — add file to Ignore List and remove it from the Malicious files list. Note that if a file is added to Ignore List, ImunifyAV will no longer scan this file
  * **View file** — click _eye_ icon in the file line and the file content will be displayed in the popup. Only the first 100Kb of the file content will be shown in case if a file has bigger size
  * **Cleanup<sup> AV+</sup>** — click to cleanup the file.
  * **Delete<sup> AV+</sup>** — remove the file from the server and from the list of Malicious files.
  * **Restore original<sup> AV+</sup>** — click _Restore original_ to restore original file after cleaning up if backup is available.

To perform a bulk action, tick required users and click the corresponding button above the table.

If a user is allowed by the administrator to run a scan at any time on his own, he can see the _Start scanning_ button.

The following filters are available:

* **Timeframe** — displays the results filtered by chosen period or date.
* **Status** — displays the results filtered by chosen status.
* **Items per page displayed** — click the number at the table bottom.

The table can be sorted by detection date (Detected), file path (File), Reason, and Status.

## Hooks <Badge text="Deprecated" type="warning"/>

:::danger Warning!
You can use a new notification system via [CLI](/cli/#notifications-config).
:::

### Overview

Hooks are introduced as a script-based interface for various application events. This is a simple and effective way to automate ImunifyAV alerts and event processing.
For example, an administrator can have ImunifyAV calling his own script when malicious files are detected or misconfigurations are detected and perform a custom processing or specific actions, for example, create a ticket.
Hooks are available only via CLI.

**Requirements**

* You can use any programming language to create a hook script
* A hook script should be executable
* For Native hooks, you should use Python 3.5 only

### How to start using hooks

Start using hooks with three simple steps:

1) Create a script to handle an event (a hook handler):
  * you can use our [scripts example](/imunifyav/#structure-and-examples-of-a-hook-script) as a template
  * [the following events are available](/imunifyav/#available-events-and-their-parameters)
2) Register your hook handler in ImunifyAV agent - use registration command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify-antivirus hook add --event <event name> --path </path/to/hook_script>
```
</div>

3) Once the event added - check results and the log file (see below)

### Available events and their parameters

* **agent**
  * subtype ( started | misconfig )
    * started - the event is generated each time the Imunify agent is started/restarted
      * params[]
        * version / string / version of agent
    * misconfig - the event is generated when the agent detects agent misconfiguration / broken settings / etc.
      * params[]
        * error / string / error message where / what type of misconfiguration was detected and some details

* **malware-scanning**
  * subtype ( started | finished )
    * started - the event is generated when the malware scanning process is started (for on-demand and background scans only, yet not the ftp / waf / inotify)
      * params[]

### Hooks CLI

The following CLI command is used to manage hooks:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify-antivirus hook [command] --event [event_name|all] [--path </path/to/hook_script>]
```
</div>

The following commands are supported:

* <span class="notranslate"> **add** </span> - register a new event handler
* <span class="notranslate"> **delete** </span> - unregister existing event handler
* <span class="notranslate"> **list** </span> - show existing event handlers
* <span class="notranslate"> **add-native** </span> - register a new native event handler

The third parameter <span class="notranslate"> _event_name_ </span> defines a particular event that invokes a registered handler as opposed to <span class="notranslate"> **all** </span> keyword.     
The fourth parameter `/path/to/hook_script` shall contain a valid path to a handler of the event, it shall be any executable or Python Native event handlers that agent will run upon a registered event.

**Native**

Native hook is a script written on Python 3.5 and allows to quickly process events. The Python file should contain only one method that customer would implement:

<div class="notranslate">

```
def im_hook(dict_param):
	….
	pass
```
</div>

where `dict_param` would hold the same data as JSON that non-Native hook will gate. 

**Log File**

You can see all hook data in the log file. It is located at <span class="notranslate"> _/var/log/imunify360/hook.log_ </span> .
When the event comes, the data is recorded to the log file in the following format:

<div class="notranslate">

```
timestamp event : id : started [native:] name :  subtype : script_path
```
</div>

* <span class="notranslate"> **native** </span> is prepended for the Native hook implementation
* <span class="notranslate"> **id** </span> is a unique ID for each event

Once the listener is done, the data is recorded to the log file in the following format:

<div class="notranslate">

```
timestamp event : id : done [native:] script_path [OK|ERROR:code]
```
</div>

In case of an error, you can see the error code you have specified.

### Structure and examples of a hook script

Regular (non-native) hook:

<div class="notranslate">

```
#!/bin/bash

data=$(cat)

event=$(jq -r '.event' <<< ${data})
subtype=$(jq -r '.subtype' <<< ${data})

case ${event} in
    malware-scanning)
        case ${subtype} in
            started)
                # do stuff here
            ;;
            *)
                echo "Unhandled subtype: ${subtype}" 1>&2
                exit 1
        esac
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unhandled event: ${event}/${subtype}" 1>&2
        exit 2
esac
```
</div>

Native hook:

<div class="notranslate">

```
def im_hook(dict_param):
   event = dict_param['event']
   subtype = dict_param['subtype']

   if event == 'malware-scanning':
       if subtype == 'started':
           # do stuff here
           pass
       elif subtype == 'finished':
           # do other stuff here
           pass
       else:
           raise Exception('Unhandled subtype {}'.format(subtype))
   else:
       raise Exception('Unhandled event {}'.format(event))
```
</div>

### Notifications

Starting from version 5.1, ImunifyAV/AV+ provides a completely new Hooks system configuration. Hooks can be configured via the separate UI “Notifications” tab in the Settings, or via the command-line interface (CLI).

![](/images/SettingsNotificationsAV.png)

The administrator can configure to execute custom scripts (“hook handler”). Also, hooks support a new set of events and notification types:

* Events occurring in each type of scan (real-time scan, user account scan, custom folder scan)
* Events occurring at different stages of malware scanning process: upon scanning start, finish, when malware is found

Each hook can be configured from the UI and the [CLI](/cli/). Each hook type has the enable/disable toggle and event handler script.

:::tip Notes
* The hook script field accepts a fully qualified path
* The hook script requires “execution” (+x) permissions to be set to work
* Email notifications available in Imunify360
